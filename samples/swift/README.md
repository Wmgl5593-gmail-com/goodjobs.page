###Chat Sample

This sample uses [anonymous authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/anonymous-auth),
so make sure anonymous auth is enabled in Firebase console.

###Auth Sample

This sample uses [email/password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/password-auth),
[Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/google-signin),
and [Facebook](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/facebook-login)
auth, so make sure those are enabled in Firebase console.

The auth example requires a little more setup (adding url schemes, etc)
since it depends on the various keys and tokens for the different auth
services your app will support. Take a look at the [Auth README](../../FirebaseAuthUI/README.md) 
for more information.
