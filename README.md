# FirebaseUI for iOS â€” UI Bindings for Firebase [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS)

FirebaseUI is an open-source library for iOS that allows you to quickly connect common UI elements to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com?utm_source=FirebaseUI-iOS) database for data storage, allowing views to be updated in realtime as they change, and providing simple interfaces for common tasks like displaying lists or collections of items.

Additionally, FirebaseUI simplifies Firebase authentication by providing easy to use auth methods that integrate with common identity providers like Facebook, Twitter, and Google as well as allowing developers to use a built in headful UI for ease of development.

FirebaseUI clients are also available for [Android](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android) and [web](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web).

## Installing FirebaseUI for iOS

FirebaseUI supports iOS 8.0+. We recommend using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/FirebaseUI), add
the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'FirebaseUI', '~> 0.6'       # Pull in all Firebase UI features
```

If you don't want to use all of FirebaseUI, there are multiple subspecs which can selectively install subsets of the full feature set:

```ruby
# Only pull in FirebaseUI Database features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Database', '~> 0.6'

# Only pull in FirebaseUI Storage features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Storage', '~> 0.6'

# Only pull in FirebaseUI Auth features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Auth', '~> 0.6'

# Only pull in Facebook login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Facebook', '~> 0.6'

# Only pull in Google login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Google', '~> 0.6'

# Only pull in Twitter login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Twitter', '~> 0.6'
```

If you're including FirebaseUI in a Swift project, make sure you also have:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
```

Otherwise, you can download the latest version of the [FirebaseUI.framework from the releases
page](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS/releases) or include the FirebaseUI
Xcode project from this repo in your project. You also need to [add the Firebase
framework](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) to your project.

## Local Setup

If you'd like to contribute to FirebaseUI for iOS, you'll need to run the
following commands to get your environment set up:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.git
$ cd FirebaseUI-iOS
$ pod install
```

Alternatively you can use `pod try FirebaseUI` in order to install objective-c or swift sample project

## Mandatory Sample Project Configuration

You have to configure Xcode project in order to run samples.

1. You project should contain `GoogleService-Info.plist` downloaded from [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).<br>
Copy `GoogleService-Info.plist` into sample project folder (`samples/obj-c/GoogleService-Info.plist` or `samples/swift/GoogleService-Info.plist`).<br>
Find more instructions and download a plist file from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

2. Update URL Types.<br>
Go to `Project Settings -> Info tab -> Url Types` and update values for:
	+ `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` (get value from `GoogleService-Info.plist`)
	+ `fb{your-app-id}` (put Facebook App Id)
	+ `twitterkit-{consumer-key}` (put Twitter App Consumer key)

3. Update `Info.plist` twitter and facebook configuration values
	+ `FacebookAppID -> {your-app-id}` (put Facebook App Id)
	+ `Fabric -> Kits -> KitInfo -> consumerKey / consumerSecret` (put Twitter App consumer key/secret). Please notice that's it's not secure to store `consumerSecret` in the app itself.

4. Enable Keychain Sharing.<br>
Facebook SDK requires keychain sharing.<br>
This can be done here: `Project Settings -> Capabilities -> KeyChain Sharing -> ON`

5. Don't forget to configure your Firebase App Database using [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).<br>
Database should contain appropriate read/write permissions and folders (`objc_demo-chat` and `swift_demo-chat` respectfully)

2. The repo owner will respond to your issue promptly.
3. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a
   Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
4. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
5. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style of the library to which
   you are contributing.
6. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
